# ReactChallenges
This project involves creating a shopping cart application using React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, view cart details, and remove items. Redux Toolkit is used to manage the state of the cart, including the addition, removal, and updating of items.
